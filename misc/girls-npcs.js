  notes: `Name: Creeping Delirium
  Possible symptoms:
  - temporary blindness
  - ear pain
  - nail brittleness
  - excess sweating (not in all cases)
  - depression (uncommon)

  What to expect: temporary blindness and ear pain may start within a few days, but not necessarily at the same time. After the initial onset, temporary blindness often increases in intensity. Around this time nail brittleness is experienced by all cases so far.
  The experience of nail brittleness is often experienced more severe due to the experience of ear pain.
  After a few more days excess sweating is experienced fairly often and is generally experienced at moderate levels.
  Throughout the course of the disease, depression may be experienced, but only in only some cases and may be experienced for a long time.
  Cause: Often injected by insects, like mosquitoes.
  Made worse by: Heavy exercise/labor. Stress. Excess vitamins.
  Treatment: Change of lifestyle.
  Rarity: 1 in 7 people have Creeping Delirium.
  CGR note: ummmmm it's worse than this, for sure. Fatal within 2mos, I'm thinking?`
