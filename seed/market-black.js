  "A living lock pick set that you have to pass a charisma check of 14 to convince it to pick a lock. If the roll is failed it becomes rude and angsty.",
  "Unassuming Box - This brown box made of an unknown and lightweight material has the odd property of being hard to pay any mind to, even in environments where it would stand out. Hiding inside of the box makes you nearly invisible when still. Moving while under the box makes no noise, but someone seeing the box move will make you automatically fails all Stealth checks. The box can be folded in order to fit inside a bag. Both folding and unfolding the box takes 5 minutes, each. For some reason, a large red ! is inscribed on the sides.",

Treat as a revolver (if you're using 5e, the rules are on page 268 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) with a built-in knife and brass knuckles. Probably not called the 'Apache' revolver unless that's a place in your setting. And yes, it's not a very practical weapon, but it seems to be selling fast.",
  "An unremarkable-looking prayer candle. A precise wax-shaping technique has been used to hide magic sigils inside the body of the candle, such that when the wick is burnt it generates a field from which no sound can escape in a 12-ft radius. The candle burns out faster than normal, though, usually in about 10 minutes. It'll simply look like you and whoever else you're meeting with are praying silently, provided you aren't gesticulating at each other.",
  "A phial of aboleth mucus.",
  "A small ivory replica of a king's crown. Its owner is able to participate in fractal chess, a version of the popular board game with no set number of players and an incomprehensibly large playing board. Players can communicate with each other, regardless of physical or planar distance, but can only do so when they make a turn, so messages by way of fractal chess are slow. There is only a single game going on, which started with its invention. There hasn't been a winner for thousands of years, but there are plenty of losers.",
  "A petrified toad. When held in the cusp of one's palm for a minute, the toad's body warms up and comes back to life.

The user cups the toad again for a minute until it petrifies, and they gain access to the toad's recent memories.",
  "A portable peephole fashioned like a circle of steel, about half as large as a human fist. The corrugated end is placed to the surface of a solid object, then rotated clockwise, causing it to sink into the surface. This creates a purely visual hole (it's a visual illusion, rather than an actual aperture) all the way through to the other end of the object.

  "A 'Calinic breed' cat. Striped purplish, it can sense poison, and prefers to eat poisoned food, even if it is full. Luckily the cat seems to be immune to poisons, toxins, acids, and venoms. It will also eat oozes and slimes. Unfortunately, it otherwise behaves like a normal cat; there are very few people who want to take care of a cat and simultaneously find a Calinic's abilities useful at this market, so the seller is probably offering the cat at a lowered price.",

  "Back-water Love potions - Very effective (DC 15 wisdom save) and lasts for 1 week. The drinker falls head-over-heels (or heels-over-head if you'd prefer) in love with whoever gave them the drink. But there's 10% chance of the drinker becomes obsessive, stalker-ish, even violent towards other potential suitors. If this occurs, the drinker will stay this way for a month instead of a week.",

Naturally nothing is there when you look. Maybe.",

  "(Drug) Feydust: A soft white powder that, in the right light, shines with soft blues and red. The powder tastes like burnt ozone, which makes it evident that it needs to be snorted. Use causes bonuses to IQ based tasks but also makes its user seek it out more and more for increasingly trivial tasks.",
  "(Drug) Halfling Weed: Most often dried, chopped, and smoked. Causes extreme emotions to abate and induces near euphoric mellow-ness and, occasionally, a user will experience mild hallucinations. Side effects include increased appetite and red, puffy eyes.",
  "(Drug) Blue sand: A substance similar to fine sand found at the beach, only that it’s deep blue colored. Consumed through the nose. One to five doses (depending on Wis or Con modifier) are enough to develop an addiction. Early effects (one to three weeks): Enhanced perception, athletics & acrobatics Following deterioration of body and mind: First (after four weeks of constant consumption): One exhaustion stack per three days without a dose. Second (after six weeks): Negative modifiers (-2) on all attributes and disadvantage on all skills. Third (after 8 weeks): Death.",
  "(Drug) Dream Flake: Thin slivers of a dried, black fungus. When place between cheek and gum, it induces hallucinations and euphoria. When smoked, the user enters an extremely vivid waking dream, which can last for hours. Extended use blackens the teeth and make 'bad trips' more common. Addictive.",

  "(Drug) Grellsvice: A drug usually administered as an oral capsule made from the spikes at the end of a grell’s tentacles. Effects last for roughly two hours on a regular 200 mg dose, and leave the user with a four-hour hangover of sorts. The main draw to grellsvice is a tingling sense in the muscles and extra-sensitive motor functionality. This comes with a strong euphoric rush whenever a new body part is moved. The drawback is the lack of motor functionality during the hangover and the incredibly dulled sense of touch accompanied with it.",
  "(Drug) Sundrop: a bright yellow/orange liquid, naturally incandescent, as if it was a liquefied ray of sunshine (henceforth the name). Originally used as a magically synthesized antidepressant, Sundrop when consumed tricks the user into believing that they are happy, as it quite literally gives them ‘warm feelings’. Over usage may leave the user feeling withered between uses, as their dependency has rendered them unable to produce dopamine and serotonin. Over time users also commonly begin to build tolerances to Sundrop, requiring greater quantities to be consumed to maintain the effect. Overdosing on Sundrop causes feverish conditions, as the drug radiates through the users veins, ultimately burning them alive from the inside out.",
  "(Drug) Patch: It works similarly to ecstasy, expanding yourself to feel the sensations all around you. It grants the ability to speak with plants and animals for 1d4+1 hours, and the comedown has a DC15 CON save. Failing the save adds one point of exhaustion immediately after waking from the first long rest you take, and lasts until completing the next long rest.",
  "(Drug) Lakua: ground silvery bark from a type of tree only found deep in swamps. Low dosages are generally taken orally. Heavier users often make a paste to apply to their gums.

Psychologically addictive not physically.",
  "(Drug) Zooterran: Made from refined Exem plums. Alters one's sense of direction and causes one to only turn right when faced with a left/right choice.",
  "(Drug) Blackroot: This lichen grows on large rocks and boulders found above timberline (the elevation at which trees do not have enough oxygen to grow). When chewed on, it causes the user to have a pleasant, tingling sensation of the lips, tongue, and gums. As well, it can give the user a sense of mental sharpness and alertness. If swallowed, it causes nausea and vomiting if the user fails a DC 13 Constitution check. If used for 1d6 hours continuously, the user must make a DC 15 Constitution check. If failed, they experience nausea, but if passed they gain advantage on Perception checks for the next 1d4 hours. Not inherently addictive, though if used for 1d12 days in a row, the user will feel extremely groggy if they do not use it every morning.",
  "(Drug) Deluge: Packaged in single-dose vials, ingesting this ethereal blue liquid gives subjects temporary access to spell-like abilities of varying degrees; usually cantrips and 1st Level spells, but sometimes more powerful spells depending on the purity of the substance. However, the temporary magic abilities come with a price: each time an individual ingests Deluge they take Constitution damage: 1d4 for average doses, 1d6 and above for purer doses. This is because the magical energy that Deluge is providing is actually taken from their own souls and continued use will cause them to gradually wither away. It’s named Deluge because it feels like a flood of energy and power washes over you.",
  "(Drug) Barb: A thorny stalk from the Cheb barb weed (looks like purple buck thorn). Sold by the branch, you can pull off individual thorns and use them to scrape or pierce the skin. The side effects are similar to pot, but too much can result in paralysis.",

  "(Drug) Espiritu: a drug derived from a certain flower commonly used in holy rituals. When blessed, left to wither for at least three days, and then dehydrated completely and turned into a powder becomes a strange blessing all it's own. If smoked or snorted, this powder grants a single question answered by a Divine being. It also grants a strong feeling of peace and euphoria, as well as a strong sense of hunger.",
  "(Drug) Devil's Root: A black root that is ground up and snorted. The user blacks out and sees visions of hell. Sometimes, these visions allow the user to see into the future.",
  "(Drug) Wandercaps: When you ingest these plain gray mushrooms, you fall into a deep trance. You experience vivid hallucinations, often nonsensical, but sometimes hinting about the events in the near future. The comedown is unpleasant.",
  "(Drug) Ember Berries: These faintly glowing black berries are used in coming-of-age rituals in a certain druidic sect. Drink a tea made from these, and you will become relaxed and calm. After a few minutes, flames begin cloaking your body - as long as you remain focused and calm, they cannot hurt you.",
  "(Drug) Bane: a mix of grinded wild herbs. Primarily consumed by smoking, it calms down the body to a point where you are so apathetic that even your greatest fears won't shock you anymore. Often used as medicine by insomniacs or lunatics, but also object to drug abuse.",
  "(Drug) Sutara: When applied to the tongue, the user can speak any language they desire, that is, if they can handle the drug. Incorrect dosage or an unprepared system will result in them speaking in absolute gibberish for the duration.",
  "(Drug) Sharpsugar: Expensive, indulged in by many performers to give them the boost of energy. Removes one level of exhaustion, gives advantage on perception checks, and adds 5 to your movement speed. User becomes jittery. Either snorted or smoked from a pipe. Made out of a rare plant that grows only on the Southern Coasts. The gangs that import it are incredibly dangerous.",
  "(Drug) Sleepysalt: Similar to sharpsugar, but with different effects. +5 temporary HP and resistance to bludgeoning damage for 1 hour. At the end of the hour, you fall asleep for another hour.",
  "(Drug) Drakeroot: Concentrated nectar of the mandrake plant. When you drink it, you go into a coma for 2 hours. During this coma, your outer layer of skin becomes more like a cocoon. At the end, you emerge with all health point fully restored and any scars gone. After 24 hours without another dose, you cannot heal using your hit die or over a long rest without using more Drakeroot. This continues until you break the addiction.",
  "(Drug) Sannish: A blue liquid distilled from the milk of wolves and a powdered desert plant. Causes euphoria and gives advantage on constitution saving throws. Very cheap, but also quite addictive. After three uses, your lips seem to be stained blue and cannot be washed off without magic like prestidigitation.",
  "(Drug) Mordayn Vapor: Also known as Dream Mist. Made from the ground leaves of a rare herb found deep in the jungle. Taken by dipping in hot water and inhaling the vapor from the tea. The raw powder and the tea are both very potent poisons. Inhaling the vapor causes intense hallucinations (albeit happy and beautiful ones). Drinking the tea or eating the powder causes 7d10 poison damage and 2d10 psychic damage. It is very illegal in every region of the world.",
  "(Drug) Cyclops Tear: Taken by eating the powder. Causes your eyes to water a ludicrous amount. The tears produced are the main attraction of this drug. They taste perfect and are guaranteed to be the best thing you have and ever will taste, but the taste varies by the person. It also only tastes that way to the person whose tears it actually is. To everyone else it tastes like tears. Overdose causes one of your eyes to desiccate and fall out. Oddly enough, people with only one eye anyway are immune to this effect, so it is very popular among Cyclopes.",
  "(Drug) Goji Leaves: Originally created as a weapon of war, Goji Leaves (when taken in just about any form) give you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, advantage on all strength checks and saving throws, and rage damage equal to a barbarian of your level. User doesn't become angry though, instead becoming far more confident than they could have ever been without it, nearly crossing the line into cocky.",
  "(Drug) Zaegoo: Harvested from a breed of gelatinous cube native to the colder regions, it causes a biting cold sensation on the way down, but gives you immunity to cold damage and the ability to withstand cold climates for 3 hours.",
  "(Drug) Terran Brandy: A brandy made out of the essence of dying fey. Gives +2 intelligence and restores 6 spell slots worth of slots (so either 6 1st levels, 1 6th level, etc.). May or may not invoke the wrath of an archfey. Only used by the most rich and powerful (and evil) archmages",
  "(Drug) Luhix: Made from the powdered stalks of a plant grown in the Abyss by demon lords to give to brainwashed cultists. Applied to an open wound that is then sealed with either bandages or magic. User has intense pain for the first minute, with -1 to all ability scores. Afterwards, user is immune to pain (they still take damage, but it doesn't bother them) and they have +2 to all ability scores for 10 minutes.",
  "(Drug) Agony: The distilled essence of pain. Mainly used by torturers as a social lubricant, but masochists will sometimes also seek it out. When the thick, reddish-brown liquid is ingested (via mouth), the user is hit by intense pain, making them unable to move for 2 rounds, having disadvantage on all ability checks for 1d6+1 minutes. During this time, target will likely give up any info.

  "(Drug) Brighteye Venom: This venom has, so far, only been consumable by having the Brighteye Spider inject the user. The bite leaves small, purplish holes and blue lines run up the veins.

  "(Drug) Druidic Dream: A mostly benign pill made by druids and sold to whoever wishes to buy some. Its ingredients and manufacture are secrets the druids keep to themselves. When held under the tongue the pill puts the user in a mild state of giddyness similar to being a 'happy drunk' for 1d4 hours (DC13 con save for half, 19 to deny), followed by 1d4 hours of sleep with idyllic dreams. Addiction 1, 10%, nature.",

Gives the user -4 intelligence and +2 wisdom while smoking it, though it takes a minute to kick in and a minute to wear off once the user stops. Acquisition: 20gp for 5 minutes worth of weed. Addiction 1, 5%, nature.",
  "(Drug) Feywillow Fruit: Fruit from a tree in the Feywild. The more the user eats, the more they want to eat. It is not harmful in and of itself, just highly addictive. Heavy users are eventually drawn into the Feywild, leaving their friends and families behind, often without saying a word. Addiction 2, nature.",

The cauldron is then heated until the flower dissolves, then left in the fire until most of the alcohol evaporates and a black sludge is left.

  "(Drug) Dreamer’s Fancy: A dark, shimmering liquid extracted from a rare root.

Upon lifting the vial to the characters nose and inhaling deeply, the user will be filled with an immense sense of power and will now be able to run, jump, swim, and lift up to 4 times as much as they previously could for 1 hour. In combat they may take an additional action once per battle. After 1 hour of usage, the user will feel sluggish and will have their senses dulled which will result in a disadvantage on perception and most strength based abilities for 4 hours or until completing a short rest. Each usage of flash powder will get weaker (-1 on the multiplier) for every time you inhale it without taking 2 weeks to recover from your body becoming immune to flash powder.",
  "(Drug) Limit Remover: A highly expensive pill that after 2 hours of ingesting grants the user the ability to cast any number of spells without restrictions for 10 minutes according to the shady vendor. In actuality it is just a mint, a coat button, or something pull shaped that gives no benefit whatsoever.",
  "(Drug) Faerie Food: There is a longstanding piece of wisdom, which says that you should never eat food offered to you by a faerie. This is absolutely true; in the Feywild, magic is so commonplace that 'cooking' is considered it's own school of magic, a mix of enchantment and illusion. Such food when eaten provides a taste that is far beyond anything a real tastebud could ever feel, and addiction is fast, difficult to resist and often lethal as mere mortal foods are not even considered food to an addict. Addiction is generally permanent, but can be cured slowly by a specialist who slowly drops the quality of food an addict ears until they can handle mortal foods again. Alternatively, if the food was eaten only once, a well-placed Modify Memory spell may cure the mental dependence.",
  "(Drug) Faerie Dust: A very fine, iridescent powder, which is kept in a wax, sealed bottle, it is consumed by unsealing the bottle and very gently wafting the contents towards the nose with a DC 10 dexterity check, with failure resulting in an overdose. When correctly dosed, instills a gentle euphoria as senses sharpen and surroundings appear more vibrant, providing advantage on investigation and perception checks for one minute. When overdosed, the user experiences sensory overload, becoming confused for one minute. Faerie Dust, despite the generic name, is actually the collected breath of a faerie dragon. They find it hilarious that mortals can get high off their breath, and will happily provide the breath attack itself with only gentle coaxing. Some faerie dragons make their home in drug dens, exchanging their breath for a luxurious lifestyle and the opportunity to ply their pranks upon the many citizens of a mortal city. Some particularly daring patrons will pay handsomely for a high 'straight from the source', taking the breath attack of the faerie dragonhead on and inhaling deeply. The high provided is incredibly intense, and as a result such services are usually only offered with the recipient strapped down on a specially constructed bench.",
  "(Drug) Shatter: A waxy, pale amber substance that can be smoked or consumed in a tincture. In lower doses it produces a pleasant high, but in higher doses (and for particularly sensitive individuals) it can cause a person to literally split in into multiple versions of themselves. If a PC consumes shatter and fails a saving throw, they are split into several nearly indistinguishable copies of themselves. A roll of 2 + 1d6 gives the number of shards. Okay, now for the catch: the character's stats must be distributed among the shards with no duplication, so the sum of the shards' abilities is the same as the original character. Additionally, all of the shards have an aspect or condition representing their intoxicated state. After a period of time at GM's discretion, the shards will coalesce and merge again into the original character.",
  "(Drug) Venge: a deep red powder of mineral origin that can be snorted for a euphoric and stimulant effect. If the character consuming it has any Berserker or Jekyll/Hyde like attributes, their Dark Side will come out 2-3 hours after ingestion, or if provoked.

  "(Drug) Mummy Powder: though its true origin is unknown, the one thing that's certain is that it doesn't come from a mummy. When a sufficient quantity is consumed mixed with wine, it puts the drinker into a catatonic state for several hours. They experience a sensation of being transported elsewhere, into a vast unlit space. Cold cyclopean stones tile the floor and neither walls nor ceiling can be found. Many experience a presence, a monstrous and unspeakably ancient intellect with only one desire: escape from the dusty emptiness of this prison and into the fullness of the waking world. This being can and will barter various intangible goods: knowledge, memories, skills. However, it only has access to such things as it could previously have acquired from another mummy powder user. Furthermore, it will not give any knowledge directly pertaining to its own nature or the nature of mummy powder. Finally, before making such a transaction, characters are filled with a sense of dread and the knowledge that the being would only have carried out such a bargain if it brought the day of its escape nearer. This can be represented by a will save if the GM wants to emphasize the direness of the act.",
  "(Drug) Forget Me Nots: These flowers grow in the wild, yellow in color. They can commonly be found in bright sunny climates. When consumed they apply a temporary new life. When consumed you believe you have a different life.

  "(Drug) Fate's Hair: a flowering plant with long sinewy fibers much like hair inside the flower.

  "(Drug) Warmroot: A small orange tinted root that on consumption, warms the body, a feeling very similar to being cozy in bed. All senses are slightly dulled.

  "(Drug) Droon: a potent, dull brown salve absorbed through one's pores, Droon greatly amplifies all sensations experienced by the body part, including proprioception. It can be an exhilarating or miserable experience, depending on how it's used- a drooned-up hand marvels at the softness of silk, but might seize up and develop rashes as the temperature fluctuates. The localized enhanced proprioception can be disorienting for new users as well, but the euphoric sensations it grants are well worth it. Droon is rumored to be the refined toxic extract of a particular tall cactus.",
  "(Drug) Ceruminal: a sparkling, faintly greenish wax originally sold as a decorative soap. A typical oral dose (about 12 grams) is enough to send an adult human of average weight into a pleasant mental fugue. They're incredibly disoriented during this time, often walking in elliptical loops, and when they eventually come down, all they remember is a sense of buoyancy and pleasant warmth. A rare few feel tiny sharp pounding at the top of their head, or dulled pain throughout their entire body. At lower doses, all it does is help clear sinuses.

However, the user's sense of their own body is greatly diminished while under the effects of Raybark, so they might trip over their own feet, swing their arms into their sides while running, or fail to properly clench their fists as their fingers miss each other. Produced and used by a convent of hippie-like pacifists who enjoy feeling more connected to the world around them.",
  "(Drug) Spiral: a flammable, forest-green liquid sold in small dropper jars, spiral is a fast-acting and addictive oral drug. A user's sinuses and sense of balance are thrown out of whack as the drug begins to take hold, making them very dizzy. It simultaneously acts to dull pain and mute powerful sensory stimuli, giving advantage on any rolls that are dependent on resisting pain, blinding light, massive sounds, terrible stenches, etc. The dizzying effect makes rolls to keep one's feet or dodge harder, however. Spiral can be slowly burnt to produce a relatively large volume of smoke that has a diluted version of its effects. The smoke seems to be lethal to most insects, and those that don't immediately die drift around aimlessly until they do.",
