Additionally, the attuned can cast Invisibility once per long rest on themselves by using a power word.

Once inside the Dream, the user must pass an Intelligence (Stealth) check to stay undetected.

  "A living lock pick set that you have to pass a charisma check of 14 to convince it to pick a lock. If the roll is failed it becomes rude and angsty.",
  "Unassuming Box - This brown box made of an unknown and lightweight material has the odd property of being hard to pay any mind to, even in environments where it would stand out. Hiding inside of the box makes you nearly invisible when still. Moving while under the box makes no noise, but someone seeing the box move will make you automatically fails all Stealth checks. The box can be folded in order to fit inside a bag. Both folding and unfolding the box takes 5 minutes, each. For some reason, a large red ! is inscribed on the sides.",

Treat as a revolver (if you're using 5e, the rules are on page 268 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) with a built-in knife and brass knuckles. Probably not called the 'Apache' revolver unless that's a place in your setting. And yes, it's not a very practical weapon, but it seems to be selling fast.",
  "An unremarkable-looking prayer candle. A precise wax-shaping technique has been used to hide magic sigils inside the body of the candle, such that when the wick is burnt it generates a field from which no sound can escape in a 12-ft radius.

  "A small ivory replica of a king's crown. Its owner is able to participate in fractal chess, a version of the popular board game with no set number of players and an incomprehensibly large playing board.

There is only a single game going on, which started with its invention. There hasn't been a winner for thousands of years, but there are plenty of losers.",
  "A petrified toad. When held in the cusp of one's palm for a minute, the toad's body warms up and comes back to life.

  "A portable peephole fashioned like a circle of steel, about half as large as a human fist. The corrugated end is placed to the surface of a solid object, then rotated clockwise, causing it to sink into the surface.

  "A 'Calinic breed' cat. Striped purplish, it can sense poison, and prefers to eat poisoned food, even if it is full. Luckily the cat seems to be immune to poisons, toxins, acids, and venoms. It will also eat oozes and slimes. Unfortunately, it otherwise behaves like a normal cat; there are very few people who want to take care of a cat and simultaneously find a Calinic's abilities useful at this market, so the seller is probably offering the cat at a lowered price.",

  "Back-water Love potions - Very effective (DC 15 wisdom save) and lasts for 1 week. The drinker falls head-over-heels (or heels-over-head if you'd prefer) in love with whoever gave them the drink.

Naturally nothing is there when you look. Maybe.",

  "A kabuki style demon mask. It gives the user advantage on intimidation checks, but disadvantage on persuasion checks, and any investigation or perception check that relies on vision, as the eye slits are too small (that could be solved with spending time to file the eye holes larger).
